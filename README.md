# More Tools

This mods added extra tier which is Emerald and Obsidian.
So, you can craft tools with those now (Hurray!).
The most useful thing you would use probably the hammer (Note: It can mine 3x3).
You won't need to worry about durability anymore XD

### How to install/play
1. Make sure you have Minecraft & forge installed (of course :P)
2. Drag the jar file into the mods folder and you're done
3. Choose the correct minecraft version and don't blame me XD

### Inspiration
I made this mod cause I'm tired of creating a mining tunnel with a pickaxe (Even with diamond pickaxe).
The durability sucks and unless you have a beacon with haste or probably a similar mod like this (Tinker's Construct), it will take a lot of time and I hate that ;)
